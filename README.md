### Restaurant Locator

Denver has a lot of good restaurants. Sometimes there are too many to choose from, you’re new to town, or your dining companions can’t agree. This is an app that will help you choose a restaurant based on your location when you can’t make a decision.

This is a recreation of my personal project created as a requirement for passing Mod 3 at the Turing School. There were several key bugs in the first project (geolocation only works occasionally, I didn't completely understand how the API was set up) and since I have the luxury of rebuilding the project, I thought I would.
